This repo is for researching Move and Sui.

It follows loosely the guides from [Move book](https://move-book.com/index.html)

To build the project run
```bash
sui move build
```

To run the tests
```bash
sui move test
```

Other variants of executing tests
```bash
# from an outside folder
sui move test --path ./path/to/project/scratch_pad_move

# running single test
sui move test test_hello
```
